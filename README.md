This is a design of an 8 Bit calculator.
The calculator take inputs in Binary.
Then we can select whichever option we want from the 8 options using the select pins: 
        0) Addition

        5) Nand
        6) Nor
        7) Xor
The last five Operations are part of the ALU (Arthemetic logic unit).

Then the binary Output is converted to BCD using the ADD-3 Method.
after which the display is in 3 7-Segment Displays
